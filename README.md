# Tweakimo 1.7.10
A small Forge mod that uses mixins to add various fixes/tweaks to the game. This mod was made because I was tired of having tons of small mods that only change 1 thing each.

## Features
Mostly everything can be configured under `Mod Options`.

### Highlights:
- ⭐ `freeCam` - Free cam port for 1.7.10 (credits below). Keybinding can be found under Miscellaneous controls.
- ⭐ `toggleSneak` - Keybinding can be found under Miscellaneous controls.
- ⭐ `sidebar` - Extensive sidebar configuration & fix. Change stuff like player limit, score color, text rendering, etc.
- `alwaysSprint` - Self explanatory.
- `blockBreakingParticles` - Allows you to disable block breaking particles for digging.
- `centerInventoryEffects` - Centers creative/survival inventory with effects.
- `flySpeed` - Set creative (or free cam) flying speed while holding SPRINT.
- `lavaVisibility` - Lets you see in lava while having Fire Resistance effect.
- `reconnectButton` - Adds a "Reconnect" button when you get disconnected from the server.
- `shortTab` - Removes empty slots in player list, making it shorter.
- `skipEndCredits` - Removes credits screen when you go through an end portal.
- `transparentConfigs` - Makes Forge config GUIs transparent.

### Miscellaneous fixes (non-configurable):
- Scoreboards now render if they have more than 15 players.
- Action bar doesn't overlap with HUD, looks like it does in 1.8+.
- Fixed villager GUI crashing when you click the "next" button too fast.

## Dependency
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This mod needs a Mixin bootstrap mod to work.

My recommendation is [UniMixins](https://modrinth.com/mod/unimixins). Other Mixin bootstrap mods will work too.
